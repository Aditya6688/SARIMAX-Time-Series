SARIMAX Time Series Forecasting
Overview
This repository provides an implementation of time series forecasting using the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) model. SARIMAX extends ARIMA by incorporating seasonality and external predictors (exogenous variables), making it suitable for more complex time series forecasting tasks.

Features
Preprocessing and visualization of time series data.
Support for both univariate and multivariate time series with exogenous variables.
Automatic parameter tuning using AIC/BIC criteria or grid search.
Handling of seasonality through SARIMA components.
Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Visualization of actual vs. forecasted values.
